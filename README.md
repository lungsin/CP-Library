# CP-Libray

This is a collection of useful code for competitive programming.

The repository is divided into multiple folders:

- `icpc-cheat-sheet`: Useful for building ICPC team reference document. The code is designed to be useful, short, fast enough and not overly generic for ICPC competition, where the code is manually typed.

- `online-contest-library` (WIP): Contains a generic and/or optimized implementation of various algorithms and data structures. Useful when you can copy-paste the code in online contest.
